        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          In the desolate expanse of the Frozen Wastes, you trudge forward,
          battling biting winds and numbing cold. Each step is a struggle
          against the elements, your senses dulled by the relentless assault of
          ice and snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tasked as mercenaries in a support team, your mission is to reach
          Frosthaven, a remote outpost in the unforgiving north. Ten days of
          arduous travel through towering snow drifts have yielded no sight of
          the town yet. Frosthaven, forgotten by most, lies isolated for half
          the year, accessible only when the Imperial Pass clears.
        </p>
        <p>
          With coin purses empty, you accepted the hazardous journey, uncertain
          of what awaits at journey's end. Questions swirl in your mind about
          the resilient souls who call Frosthaven home, surviving the harsh
          winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Amidst the desolation, one hope persistsâ€”that a welcoming fire
            awaits you upon arrival.</em

        <h1>Scenario 1: A Town in Flames</h1>
        <p class="goal">
          <strong>Goal:</strong>
          kill all enemies
        </p>
        <p>
          As you approach, the cacophony of battle greets you, a symphony of
          metal clashes and desperate cries. Despite the wind's roar, the
          unmistakable signs of a skirmish signal proximity to the town.
        </p>
        <p>
          Urgency propels you forward, your wearied body propelled by the
          promise of civilization. With each step, the tumult grows louder,
          illuminated by the flickering orange glow of flames dancing in the
          air. Finally, rounding the bend, Frosthaven emerges, engulfed in
          infernal chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fire engulfs buildings, and panicked townsfolk flee from the onslaught
          of a monstrous Algox raider, its massive form wreathed in thick fur
          and crowned with formidable horns.
          <br />
          Amidst the chaos, despair grips a nearby porter, lamenting their
          seemingly futile journey.
          <br />Yet, as the Algox demonstrates its terrifying strength, flinging
          a hapless victim aside, resolve surges within you. Ten days of arduous
          trekking have led to this pivotal moment. <br />With determination,
          you ready your weapon, bracing for the harrowing battle ahead.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          After fighting relentlessly, the Algox retreat, scurrying from
          Frosthaven like giant white mice. 
          <br/>
          One of the townspeople (<code>Satha</code>) marches right for you to thank you for your help.
          <br/>
          You explain who you are and that you were sent from White Oak. 
          This visibly annoys <code>Satha</code> because she thinks help from the
          capital was long overdue as it was the Merchant's Guild that stuck
          their noses in Frosthaven's business, and started this whole mess. 
          </p>
          <p>
          She goes on to explain that last summer, the Merchant's Guild sent people
          to Frosthaven to check how it could be "of more use to the empire".
          <br/>
          One of their expeditions messed with an Algox burial site, and the
          next thing they knew, angry Algox started attacking Frosthaven. The
          people from the Merchant's Guild high-tailed it out of there and left
          only a handful of soldiers behind to help. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <code>Satha</code> has sent a scout ahead to follow the retreating Algox to their hideout(s). 
          <br/>
          Upon the return of the scout, he gives you two options to continue the journey: 
          <ol>
            <li>
              A group of Algox entered a cave at the base of Snowscorn Mountain (Scenario 3)
            </li>
            <li>
              A smaller group split off and hiked around the mountain, a suspected secret entrance to the Algox stronghold (Scenario 2)
            </li>
          </ol>
